Web services are Apex code that you expose out and can consume with either SOAP or REST.  
Typically this is used to expose complex buisness logic in an easily consumable way. 
For example, you could use a web service to combine together an account with all of itâ€™s contacts and return them in a single call. 
In this article we will be covering SOAP endpoints, but most of the principles also apply to REST endpoints.
